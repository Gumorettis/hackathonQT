# Questrade Hackathon

This project is a loan simulator that has two kinds of users:
Admin
Regular user

Admin can execute a data analysis to extract valuable information for the 
business.

Regular users can register themselves on the system to see the maximum value that they can get when doing a loan.

The below diagram shows how they interact within the system and how the system interacts with each component.
